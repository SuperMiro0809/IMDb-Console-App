## About The Project
This is a console-based application designed to simulate a simplified version of the IMDb (Internet Movie Database) system. Developed as part of a course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, the application allows users to interact with a movie database through a text-based interface.

Key features include:
* **Movie Management**: Users can view, rate, search movies by title and genre, sort movies by title and rating and filter by rating. Administrators can add, update and delete movies.
* **Sorting & Searching**: The application supports sorting movies by title or rating in ascending or descending order and provides searching by tilte and genre.
* **Actor and Director**: Information: Detailed information about movie directors and actors is accessible, including a list of actors associated with each movie.
* **Rating System**: Movies can be rated, and the application supports sorting movies based on their ratings.
